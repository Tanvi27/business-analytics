Created our own dataset through mockaroo.com and generated the details of the hostels in Ireland.
Then we further loaded the dataset into Microsoft Dynamics 365 crm for further etl processes and created CRM dashboards from admin point of view.
After that we uploaded our project from Microsoft Dynamics to PowerBI and created dashboards and define business goals and how can Irish Hostel Times improvise further in the areas where it is lacking.
The dashboards created in PowerBI can define the overall business scenarios of the organization.
